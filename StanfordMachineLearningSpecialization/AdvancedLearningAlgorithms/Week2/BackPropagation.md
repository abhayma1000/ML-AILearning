## Computation Graph
* Steps we need to compute the cost function comes from smaller steps
* Need to find partial derivatives via chain rule: How does one thing earlier change with respect to something later on
* Back prop goes backwards to calculate partial derivatives (via chain rule) to update the parameters

## Larger NN Example
* How does comp graph work on large example?
